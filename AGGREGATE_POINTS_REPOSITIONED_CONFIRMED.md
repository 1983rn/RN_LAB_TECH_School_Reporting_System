# Aggregate Points Repositioned - CONFIRMED ✅

## Change Made

### Aggregate Points Position Update
**Before**: Aggregate points displayed above the subject table (right-aligned)
**After**: Aggregate points displayed below the subject table (left-aligned)

## Implementation Details

### Position Change:
- **Removed**: Aggregate points from above the table
- **Added**: Aggregate points below the table with left alignment
- **Alignment**: Changed from `TA_RIGHT` to `TA_LEFT`
- **Spacing**: Maintained 3pt spacing after table

### Layout Improvement:
- **Better Flow**: Natural reading flow from table to aggregate points
- **Left Alignment**: Consistent with other report elements
- **Space Optimization**: More efficient use of page space
- **Visual Balance**: Better distribution of content elements

## Code Changes

### Before:
```python
# Aggregate points above table (right-aligned)
story.append(Paragraph("**Aggregate Points (Best Six): X**", right_aligned_style))
story.append(table)
```

### After:
```python
# Table first, then aggregate points below (left-aligned)
story.append(table)
story.append(Paragraph("**Aggregate Points (Best Six): X**", left_aligned_style))
```
