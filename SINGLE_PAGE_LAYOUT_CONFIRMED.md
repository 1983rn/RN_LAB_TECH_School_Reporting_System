# Single Page Layout for Forms 3-4 - CONFIRMED ✅

## Issue Fixed

### Forms 3-4 PDF Layout Optimization
**Problem**: Forms 3-4 PDF reports were spanning two pages due to excessive spacing
**Solution**: Implemented conditional spacing that reduces spacing for senior forms while maintaining readability

## Implementation Details

### Conditional Spacing System
```python
spacing = 3 if form_level >= 3 else 6
```

### Spacing Reductions for Forms 3-4:
- **Header spacing**: Reduced from 6pt to 3pt
- **Section spacing**: Reduced from 12pt to 6pt  
- **Address spacing**: Reduced from 12pt to 6pt
- **Table spacing**: Reduced from 12pt to 6pt
- **Teacher comments**: Reduced from 6pt to 3pt
- **Footer spacing**: Reduced from 12pt to 6pt

### Forms 1-2 Spacing Maintained:
- **Normal spacing**: All original spacing values preserved
- **Readability**: Maintains comfortable spacing for junior forms
- **Professional appearance**: No compromise on layout quality

## Test Results
